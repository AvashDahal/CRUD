This is my 2nd springboot practice project. Here I focused on implementation of a RESTful API that facilitates CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete)operations for managing products.
This practice project was my way to gain hands-on experience in developing a backend application.
Features I implemented:

Connectivity and Spring JPA:

I understood the establishment of a robust connection between the backend application and a relational database(MySql)
using dependency.
I used Spring Data JPA, which provides a powerful way to interact with the database through JPA repositories.
I found this to be efficient in performing database operations.

Lombok Annotations:

I used Lombok annotations which reduced boilerplate code, improved code readability, and well is less tedious than using
the conventional method
More specifically I used annotations such as @Data, @Getter, @Setter, @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor etc,
to automatically generate getters, setters, constructors, and other repetitive code structures.

RESTful API Mappings:

I implemented RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations to manage product entities.
Utilized HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and appropriate URL mappings to handle corresponding CRUD operations.

CRUD Operations:

This application has CRUD functionality for products, that enables users to:
Create new products by providing essential details like name, quantity, and price through POST requests.
Retrieve a list of all products or specific products by their IDs or names through GET requests.
Update existing products by modifying their attributes via PUT requests.
Delete products by their IDs through DELETE requests.

Learning Outcome:
I learned a lot doing this project. Did refer to a tutorial to get idea about connectivity and also learnt about Lombok
there. Then I took the idea and I started this project. I learnt a lot about Spring Jpa, Mappings, ResponseEntities,pos-
tman. In short, I learned the following:
RESTful API design principles.
Establishing database connectivity and leveraging Spring JPA for database operations.
Utilizing Lombok annotations to simplify code structure and improve maintainability.
Practicing and implementing CRUD operations using Spring Boot, enabling data manipulation within the application.

Future Enhancements:

While this project focused on fundamental CRUD operations, I understood there are still many future enhancements
that can be made like:

Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure endpoints.
Adding validation checks to ensure data integrity.
Implementing additional functionalities such as pagination, sorting, or filtering for product retrieval.
Enhancing error handling and providing meaningful responses for different scenarios.
